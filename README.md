Use at own risk!  I think the way this is implemented really goes against the grain of Meteor constructs, but in some cases it might be useful as a meta sort of approach to Template coding.

Some Potential Practical Applications are :

-Education, where the user can try out spacebars syntax out as part of a tutorial about Blaze, Meteor and data context. 

-CMS, where the system allows site admins to customize the appearance of the app by editing the Template code for a given page, I know that Big Cartel and similar CMS systems expose this functionality to customize the appearance for online stores.

-in-app Template inspector, similar to a browser's html inspector.
