Meteor Live Template Editor

Allows user to edit a Meteor Template and see the changes in realtime.

 Stores Template code and CSS in the database. 

Potential Practical Applications : 
May be useful for education, where the user can try various things out as part of a tutorial about Blaze and Meteor. This method could be used as part of a CMS, where the system allows site admins to customize the appearance of the app by editing the Template directly for a given page, I know that Big Cartel exposes this functionality to customize the appearance for online stores.
