Running tests : 

add mike:mocha
add accounts-password
the tests will run in the browser

when you're done remove accounts-password,

I need accounts-password for the tests for now, but I don't accounts-password in the {{> loginButtons}}.

TODO : write custom login for loginWithGithub only so we don't have to manually manage these packages.
